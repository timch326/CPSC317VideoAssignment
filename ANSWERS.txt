=== Observed behaviour ===

Describe in general words the observed behaviour of each of these servers and 
how it affects the video playback experience. Then explain what you believe is
happening and what is causing the described behaviour.

* FUNKY A
Stuttering happens, possibly frames being dropped

* FUNKY B
Stuttering worse than A, frames being dropped

* FUNKY C
"Bouncing" happens, frames are arriving out of order

* FUNKY D
More bouncing and stuttering, frames are probably being dropped 
and arriving out of order

* FUNKY E
Extremely fast playback, frames are arriving extremely quickly

* FUNKY F
Slow playback, frames are arriving slowly on connection

* FUNKY G
Stuttering and slow playback, frames are being dropped and packets
arriving slowly

* FUNKY H
Video plays normally but pauses a few times, probably due to a 
certain packet not being retrieved on time


=== Statistics ===

You may add additional columns with more relevant data.

=== Result of analysis ===
Used functioning PART B to explain, possibly use master branch?

Explain in a few words what you believe is actually happening based on the statistics above.

* FUNKY A
Packets are arriving out of order but none are far behind enough to be dropped

* FUNKY B
Packets arrive slowly and out of order but not slow enough to be discarded

* FUNKY C
Packets are arriving timely but out of order and are eventually dropped to wait for
the correct sequence.

* FUNKY D
Packets are arriving slowly and out of order, leading to them being dropped

* FUNKY E
Packets are arriving extremely fast and many are out of order, but this doesn't lead 
to any packets being dropped

* FUNKY F
Packets are arriving half the rate of average time, but fast enough for waiting on them
so they aren't dropped

* FUNKY G
Even slower than F with the packets being out of order, but again, not slow enough to 
be dropped

* FUNKY H
Packets arrive timely but very infrequent out of order packets occur
