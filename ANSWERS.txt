=== Observed behaviour ===

Describe in general words the observed behaviour of each of these servers and 
how it affects the video playback experience. Then explain what you believe is
happening and what is causing the described behaviour.

* FUNKY A
The video occasionally stutters, but it is not too perceptible to cause much discomfort in the viewing experience. Some frames might have been dropped, or there is some jitter.

* FUNKY B
The video stutters much more often than A. The issue is definitely perceptible and makes the video feel pretty choppy. Like A, frames are being dropped or there is some presence of jitter, but in a much higher degree.

* FUNKY C
The video stutters and "bounces" around. The "bouncing" is frustrating and makes the video nearly unwatchable. Frames must be arriving out of order.

* FUNKY D
The video does more bouncing and stuttering, the video is too difficult to watch. Frames are probably being dropped and arriving out of order frequently.

* FUNKY E
Extremely fast playback of the video. The video looks like it's being played twice as faster than normal. Frames are arriving extremely quickly to the client.

* FUNKY F
Slow playback of the video. This is the opposite as E, the video seems to be playing twice as slow. Frames are arriving slowly on connection.

* FUNKY G
Stuttering and slowness is apparent in the video. The video is not watchable. Frames are likely being dropped and packets are arriving slowly to the client.

* FUNKY H
Video plays normally but pauses a few times. The video is watchable, but the pauses are annoying. This is probably due to some packets not being retrieved on time in the server to be sent to the client.

=== Result of analysis ===
Used functioning PART B to explain, possibly use master branch?

Explain in a few words what you believe is actually happening based on the statistics above.

* FUNKY A
There is some minor jitter and dropped frames in the connection. The connection might be slightly congested.

* FUNKY B
Similar to A, but with more jitter and dropped frames in the connection. The connection is very congested.

* FUNKY C
Packets are arriving out of order but none of them were lost. There is some jitter as well. Packets may be travelling from different routes.

* FUNKY D
Half of all packets are being dropped with a lot of jitter. Some of them are out of order as well. The connection might be over utilized and dropping many packets.

* FUNKY E
Packets are arriving at a very fast rate and half of them are being dropped, but jitter is neligible. The server might be specified to send the frames at the wrong rate.

* FUNKY F
Packets are arriving half the rate of average time but no packets are dropped. There is little jitter. The connection may have low bandwidth.

* FUNKY G
The frames are arriving just as slowly as F, but some of them are dropped. The connection may have low bandwidth, and may be congested.

* FUNKY H
Arriving packets ocassionally ocassionally pauses and then tries "catching up" by sending a higher rate of packets afterwards. The connection is suffering intermittent congestion, causing such jitter.
